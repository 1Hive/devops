## 1Hive User Feedback Bounties

Hi! We're looking for people who want to explore, build, and use our apps - and then tell us about it. We want to know what your experience was like so that we can make our apps the best they can be. We expect that the process of reading through our documentation, trying out the app, and then answering questions to provide feedback will take about an hour. 

For this favor we are forever in your debt, but we are also happy to provide some 1Hive HONEY tokens as a symbol of our appreciation.

Our bounties are as follows:

### Basic Review: 10 HONEY
- You read the docs, tried the app, and answered the questions.

### Bonus Review: 30 HONEY
- You read the docs, tried the app, and answered the questions.
- You then provided detailed suggestions to fix any problems you encountered (just like with Bug Bounties, we'll assess the severity of the problem you described as well as if your suggestions would actually fix the problem).

### Above and Beyond Review: 50 HONEY (or more)
- You read the docs, tried the app, and answered the questions.
- You then provided detailed suggestions to fix any problems you encountered (just like with Bug Bounties, we'll assess the severity of the problem you described as well as if your suggestions would actually fix the problem).
- You actually wrote code that fixed the problem, submitted a PR, and we merged the PR.

<br />

> Note: if you'd like to try breaking/exploiting our apps for fun and profit please see our [Bug Bounty Program](https://1hive.org/contribute/bug-bounty).
